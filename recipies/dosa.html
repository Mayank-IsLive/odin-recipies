    <img src="img/dosa.jpg" alt="Masala Dosa">
    <h2>Discriptions :</h2>
    <p>Masala dosa is a popular <strong>South Indian </strong>, featuring a crispy, thin crepe made from fermented rice
        and lentil batter, typically filled with a spiced potato mixture. It's served with sambar (a lentil-based
        vegetable stew) and chutneys (often coconut and tomato-based). The spiced potato filling, or "masala," usually
        includes boiled and mashed potatoes, onions, and various spices. Variations exist, such as Mysore masala dosa,
        which includes a layer of <strong>red chutney</strong>, and <strong>rava masala dosa</strong>, made with
        <strong>semolina.</strong>
